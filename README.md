Orginally, this sound data set was recorded for a project called Studio On Line (SOL) at Ircam in Paris (1996-1999). The data set contains an intrument playing a single musical note . In total, there are 14 different instruments, which are listed below. 

1. Bass Tuba
2. French Horn
3. Trombone
4. Trumpet in C
5. Accordion

9. Violoncello
10. Bassoon
11. Clarinet in B-flat
12. Flute
13. Oboe
14. Alto Saxophone

TinySOL Data:

The TinySOL data set contains 2913 audio WAV files at 44.1 kHz. Each audio file has an instrument playing one musical note. The information of the insturment family and sound, oridinary playng technique, pitch, dynamic, additional information can be found in the file path. Moreover, this information can be found in the metadata as text, which can be furthered cleaned, organized, and analyzed. 

Metadata Data:

The TinySOL_metadata.csv contains text data and information of each path file in the TinySOL. The csv file contains the path, fold ID, instrument family, abbreviation, name, technique abbreviation and name, pitch, pitch ID, dynamic, dynamic ID, instance ID, string ID, and the need for digital retuning.
